⚠️ **Version 0.7 – Breaking Changes Ahead**  
This release **will break existing setups**.  


# 🚀 BlogposterCMS

**The Composable Sandbox for Building Websites Without Chains**

> Forget monolithic CMS. Think modular freedom – with a builder that will one day make Canva jealous.

---

## 🎯 The Mission

BlogposterCMS isn’t just another CMS.
It’s a **composable platform** built for creators, developers, and teams who want **full control without bloat**.
The endgame?
A system that’s as **intuitive as a design tool**, as **flexible as a developer’s sandbox**, and as **future-proof as microservices** – all without the lock-in nonsense.

---

## 📌 Key Features (and why they matter)

* 🧩 **Composable & Modular**
  Load only what you need. Keep your project lean, your code clean, and your sanity intact.

* 🔐 **Secure by Design**
  Built-in sandboxing, granular permissions, and JWT-secured events.
  Because “ship now, patch later” isn’t a strategy – it’s a lawsuit waiting to happen.

* 🎨 **Visual Builder with CanvasGrid** *(Alpha)*
  Place responsive widgets exactly where you want them.
  The UX is “usable” now – aiming for Canva-level fluidity.

* 📦 **Database Freedom**
  PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite – pick your weapon.
  No “our way or the highway” here.

* 🚀 **AI & Microservice Ready**
  Extend with your own AI workflows or run modules as microservices.
  Future you will thank present you.

* 🌐 **Performance + SEO**
  Lightning-fast output with solid SEO.
  No dark rituals required for page speed.

## 📍 Where We’re Going

Blogposter is moving towards becoming **the Figma for websites**:

* A drag-and-drop builder that’s fast, fluid, and fun.
* A secure, extensible backend that doesn’t choke under scale.
* A marketplace for widgets, templates, and full site kits.
* Deployment options from self-hosted to fully managed.

The goal is simple: **own your content, own your stack, own your future**.
