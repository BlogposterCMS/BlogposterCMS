⚠️ **Version 0.7 – Breaking Changes Ahead**  
This release **will break existing setups**.  


#  BlogposterCMS

**The Composable Sandbox for Building Websites Without Chains**

> Forget monolithic CMS. Think modular freedom – with a builder that will one day make Canva jealous.

---

##  The Mission

BlogposterCMS isn’t just another CMS.
It’s a **composable platform** built for creators, developers, and teams who want **full control without bloat**.
The endgame?
A system that’s as **intuitive as a design tool**, as **flexible as a developer’s sandbox**, and as **future-proof as microservices** – all without the lock-in nonsense.

---

##  Key Features (and why they matter)

*  **Composable & Modular**
  Load only what you need. Keep your project lean, your code clean, and your sanity intact.

*  **Secure by Design**
  Built-in sandboxing, granular permissions, and JWT-secured events.
  Because “ship now, patch later” isn’t a strategy – it’s a lawsuit waiting to happen.

*  **Visual Builder with CanvasGrid** *(Alpha)*
  Place responsive widgets exactly where you want them.
  The UX is “usable” now – aiming for Canva-level fluidity.

  *  **Workspace-Driven Navigation**
  Organize pages by workspace with dynamic headers, quick-create panels, and nested subpages for sane site structure.

*  **Static Export & Media Manager** *(Alpha)*
  Publish builder designs as static HTML/CSS/JS and manage assets safely in the media library.

*  **Database Freedom**
  PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite – pick your weapon.
  No “our way or the highway” here.

*  **AI & Microservice Ready**
  Extend with your own AI workflows or run modules as microservices.
  Future you will thank present you.

*  **Performance + SEO**
  Lightning-fast output with solid SEO.
  No dark rituals required for page speed.

---

##  Where We’re Going

Blogposter is moving towards becoming **the Figma for websites**:

* A drag-and-drop builder that’s fast, fluid, and fun.
* A secure, extensible backend that doesn’t choke under scale.
* A marketplace for widgets, templates, and full site kits.
* Deployment options from self-hosted to fully managed.

The goal is simple: **own your content, own your stack, own your future**.
