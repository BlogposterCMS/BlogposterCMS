# BlogposterCMS 🚀  
*A modular CMS built exactly how you want it.*

**Release Date:** April 24, 2025  

---

## TL;DR

**BlogposterCMS** is a lightweight, Node.js-powered content management system focused on a simple philosophy:  
**Everything is modular. Keep the core small.** No heavy frameworks, no rigid rules—just clean, modular code, event-driven architecture, and your imagination.

## Key Features ⚡

| Feature                 | Quick Overview                                                                |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mother Core**         | The heart of the system (`mother/`) manages global middleware, authentication, and event-driven communication. |
| **True Modularity**     | Build your features in `modules/<yourModule>`, plug them in via events—simple and effective. |
| **JWT-secured Events**  | Secure, signed JWT tokens ensure safe and decoupled communication between modules. |
| **Frontend Freedom**    | Default Alpine.js setup for client-side rendering, but you're free to integrate React, Vue, htmx, or even classic SSR. |
| **Easy Debugging**      | Clean separation of frontend and backend logic. Debug without wading through spaghetti code. |
| **Open MIT License**    | No lock-in. Fork, tweak, deploy, sell as SaaS—it's completely your choice. |
