      <p>It brings the vision of Blogposter a step forward: with workspaces you can create work areas and shape your workflow however you want. Place widgets wherever it suits you and pages exactly the same.</p>
      <p>Apps now complete the final trinity of Blogposter alongside modules for the backend and widgets for the dashboard. With apps you can run fullscreen applications. The designer app is a good demonstration of how apps should be used. For most use cases widgets are completely sufficient. Apps can only be launched through widgets. The goal is always user friendliness.</p>
