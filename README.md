## üìå Key Features

- üß© **Composable & Modular**  
  Every module isolated. Only what you need, nothing you don't.

- üîê **Secure by Design**  
  Built-in sandbox. JWT-secured event system. Granular permissions.  
  *You know, security for people who actually like sleeping at night.*

- üé® **Drag-and-Drop CanvasGrid**  
  Arrange responsive widgets visually.  
  *Currently, the UX is at ‚Äûbetter than nothing‚Äú level, aiming for Canva-level one day.*

- üì¶ **Choose Your Database**  
  PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite.  
  *Because some devs still get emotional about databases.*

- üöÄ **AI & Microservices Ready**  
  Extend endlessly, integrate smoothly.  
  *Microservices: solving problems you wouldn't have without them.*

- üåê **Performance & SEO-Friendly**  
  Fast-loading, optimized pages.  
  *We didn‚Äôt sacrifice goats for this speed, promise.*
